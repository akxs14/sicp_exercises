# SICP exercises

My solutions to the exercises in "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"

I don't have time to write code in my day job anymore so I prefer to do it without causing trouble for my teammates.

For this reason I decided to read the classic book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", while I will work through the exercises in the book.

If you want to read the book online, you can access it <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">here</a>, in MIT Press' website.

## Environment used

Dr. Racket 7.0, examples should work with it.

## Structure

Chapter directories with a flat structure and the bigger exercises within their own directories.
